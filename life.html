    <h3>Get involved:</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Don't be afraid to make mistakes:</h3>
    <p>"Allowing yourself to make mistakes can help you learn and grow as a person. Don’t be afraid to take risks and get involved. Don't be scared to ask questions, the worse it can do is help you." - Connor</p>
    <h3>Have a balance between life and school:</h3>
    <p>"Having a balance between life and school is very important, as putting too much time into either one can have negative effects on both parts of your life. It is good to identify the important parts of each part of your life" - Connor</p>
    <h3>Forge good relationships with teachers:</h3>
    <p>"When starting school, it’s important to identify the teachers who are actually trying to help you succeed. Forging good relationships with them can help you have a better time in class and enjoy it more. These teachers can also help you if you are struggling in that class." - Connor</p>

    <h3>Stay on top of your work:</h3>
    <p>"Try to keep your grades up consistently through your sophomore, junior AND senior year, this will prepare you for college with your good study habits, make you eligible for more scholarships, give you a better work ethic and more." - Lucky</p>

    <h3>Try your best:</h3>
    <p>"Do your best and try not to get lazy because the hard work you do will pay off." - Daniel</p>

    <h3>Don't focus on the things you can't control:</h3>
    <p>"Doing so may put you down and wont change the way things are. It’s good to remember that there are things in life you don’t have control over, and that’s okay. Instead focus on what you can change." - Kaelem</p>

    <h3>Your grades do not determine your worth:</h3>
    <p>"The only thing they say about you is how much effort you put into achieving them. So strive for your best and don’t waste your time!" - Anthony</p>
